# DecLeaderboard
This is a static website example that shows how to make calls to Decisions flows and reports. To run this, You will need to import the Leaderboard zip file into your decisions instance and replace the URLs used for calls in each of JS files with the correct ones in your instance.

The main page is index.html. The "Add Record" and "Add Player" work through calls to flows in Decisions and each of the tables are populated from reports in Decisions.
